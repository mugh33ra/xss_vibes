- WAF: This tool can now detect web application firewalls and then use specialized payloads to bypasss them.
- Custom WAF: You can choose payloads that are designed for specific waf.
- Crawler: You can now run katana within the tool to find the links first and then look for vulnerabilities.

### FEATURES

- Customizable: You can add your custom payload using adder.py
- Dynamic: The tool will prioritize the payloads based on the target's behavior
- Scalable: You can use this tool on bunch of links
- Speed: Send concurrent request to multiple urls

### I N S T A L L A T I O N

```
(Please Install Katana into your machine to access the full potential of this tool)
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/faiyazahmad07/xss_vibes
2. Install the requirements file: pip3 install -r requirements
3. Run the main.py file
```

### USAGE
```
python3 main.py -f <filename> -o <output>

-f: Filename that contains bunch of links
-o: Output filename in which all the vulnerable endpoints is stored
-t: No of threads[Increase the threads if you want more speed] (Max: 10)
-u: Single URL to scan.
-H: Custom Headers.(PLease use , within "" to add multiple headers)
--crawl: Crawl the links first and then find xss

Using  multiple  headers:
python3 main.py -f urls.txt -H "Cookies:test=123;id=asdasd, User-Agent: Mozilla/Firefox" -t 7 -o result.txt

Using  single  header:
python3 main.py -f urls.txt -H "Cookies:test=123;id=asdasd" -t 7 -o result.txt

Scanning single URL:
python3 main.py -u http://example.com/hpp/?pp=12 -o out.txt

Detect waf & scan:
python3 main.py -u http://example.com/hpp/?pp=12 -o out.txt --waf

Specify waf manually:

python3 main.py -u http://example.com/hpp/?pp=12 -o out.txt -w cloudflare

Using PIPE

cat katana.txt | python3 main.py --pipe -t 7
```
